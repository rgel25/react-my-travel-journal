## Welcome! üëã

My Travel Journal is a simple React app showcasing my basic implementations of props.

_Note: This web application is not mobile-friendly as it's not the goal of this project_

## The challenge

The main challenge here is to display three components with different props coming from a single array of objects.

## My solution

To solve the challenge, I used Array Mapping to render three instances of the Entry component while passing each array element as props.
